### **General Guidelines**

- You can use this repository as template to create yours.
- Once created you can add Karthik, Mazahir, Jagan as collaborators.
- Make sure to refer to the above vercel deployment step before starting your work. 
1. **Make sure to create an Issue and PR for the create react app step.**
    - This is so that those steps do not get mixed with PRs created for feature issues.
2. **Create appropriate issues as you build your application.** 
3. **Send a pull request and do not push anything to master directly**
    - Please send a pull request if you want to bring any change to the repo.
    - Do not push to master directly.
    - There is no need to assign any pull request to the collaborator but do make sure to look out for any comments on the same from us.
    - You need to merge all your pull requests yourself.
4. **Production-ready code**
    - Approach this problem as if it is an application going to production.
    - We don't expect it to be perfect (no production code is), but we also don't want you to hack together a throw-away script.
    - This should be representative of something that you would be comfortable releasing to a production environment.
    - Once you finish building the dashboard, try it out yourself to see if there are any edge-cases that you missed.
    - You may use whatever packages and tools that you think are appropriate.
    - We are looking for you to demonstrate your knowledge related to common software practices to include reusability, portability, and encapsulation - to name a few.
5. **Make commits incrementally.**
    - ***Please do not squash commit before creating the pull request. We want to see incremental commits***.
6.  **Deploy the application**
    - Deploy the application on Vercel. Post the link of the deployed application as a comment in the issue.
7.  **Ready for code review**
    - As a final step post a comment in the issue saying " **@karthiknmenon** , **@mazahirharoon**, **@jagankaartik** The application is ready for the code review.**" and assign the issue to your collaborator.".
